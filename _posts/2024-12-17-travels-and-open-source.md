title: Travels & open source
description: What I've been upto in the last 6 months
---

I haven't written on this blog in some time, and most of my posts here are very
technical (more like tutorials). However, I just returned from ~6 months of
travel and a lot has happened in that time that I figured it'd be fun to share.
So here goes!

## Leaving my job

I had a pretty fun job as an engineering lead/principal with a really awesome
team alongside me. It gave me many opportunities to mentor people in the areas
I love, and introduce so many engineers to things I care about a lot (like web
components and web standards).

However, I've always loved travelling and had an itch in my brain for a long
time now, wanting to head in some random direction for a few months and see
more of the world.

In the end, I decided I've learnt what I can learn at my job, making now the
perfect time to finally go do that!

## Travelling

I'm already pretty well travelled and have done countless solo trips over
many years. Combine that with the fact I'm happy without much of a plan, I
pretty much had to choose a direction and head that way.

I decided on a few things:

- Aim to head East until I'm back home (i.e. go all the way around)
- Spend half of the trip exploring, half of it meeting up with friends I
haven't seen in a while
- Start with a Europe trip, somehow reach Vietnam, and figure the rest out
from there

It is worth noting that I did actually come back to the UK for a week
after the Europe portion of the trip (for arctangent festival!).

I planned most of my travel days only a day or two before, but I did have
a shortlist of cities I wanted to try reach for the second half of my trip
(since I wanted to meet up with specific people).

In the end, these are the countries I visited:

- Belgium
- Germany
- Austria
- Hungary (where I finally got to hang out with
[@patak.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/patak.dev)!)
- Czech Republic
- Poland
- Vietnam
- Japan
- Singapore
- Philippines
- Australia
- New Zealand
- USA (including good catch ups with
[@marcushellberg.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/marcushellberg.dev) and
a few of the [@lit.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/lit.dev) team)
- Canada

From Canada, I also did a _small_ detour to Germany to see some friends I made
in Vietnam and visit some Christmas markets. Great fun!

Overall, good trip. Made a lot of new friends, visited a few old friends, and
saw a lot of really awesome places.

## Open source

One of the perks of having no job (for now) is that I have a bunch more
time to spend on my open source efforts!

This came at the ideal time, as we'd just launched the
[e18e](https://e18e.dev) community. Being able to spend more time on that,
especially during the growing phase, has been super nice.

I've been able to work with so many like-minded people on all sorts of
performance improvements across the ecosystem. Not only cleanups, but
deep dives into CPU and memory profiles and much more.

We can't forget, though, that I maintain and contribute to a whole bunch of
projects already. So I've basically been splitting my time between those
(e.g. chai, tinylibs, chokidar) and e18e.

This has been quite a lot of work but so much fun at the same time. Focusing
on the things I care about and providing a whole bunch of useful things
for the community.

## What's next?

I'll be focusing a lot on e18e still, trying to help grow the community and
have a larger effect on the performance of the tools and web apps we all use.

I have no idea what work I will end up in next, but I'll always manage to cut
a chunk of time out for my OSS efforts.

Of course, I'll probably also end up travelling again now that I've got
the bug!
